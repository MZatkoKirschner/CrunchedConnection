Clear Connections

Motivation
Missed connections are costly for airlines and are strongly-negative experiences for travelers. In fact, with these concerns in mind, United recently unveiled an AI-based tool called 'ConnectionSaver' that holds planes for several minutes so very tight connections can be made.

Airlines and their customers would benefit if individual customers (and ideally airlines) could proactively alter flight itineraries for those who are likely to miss their original flight connections due to weather.

The 'ClearConnection' dashboard uses machine learning, flight data, and weather forecasts to estimate the probability of a missed connection.
