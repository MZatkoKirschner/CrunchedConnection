The project directory contains raw, processed, and cleaned sub-directories within the 'data' directory. Each subdirectory contains individual flight and met data directories. Code found in the 'scripts' directory relies on inputs files from the 'raw' data directories. Code in the 'scripts' directory generates output files in the 'processed' data directory.

The processed flight and met datasets are generally quite large (at least 1 GB in size) and are not uploaded here.
